        > ‚ö†Ô∏è A minimal reproduction is required to demonstrate the bug, and for us to debug it. If not provided, the issue will be closed.

        Provide a link to a minimal reproduction repository so we can `git clone`, run `npm start`, and reproduce the bug right away.

        Starter template: [fork this template on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-guv65j?file=webpack.config.js&view=editor)

        #### Requirements:
        - No more than 10 files
          Delete irrelevant files (e.g. `LICENSE`, `.npmrc`, `.github`). This is the first step of debugging so doing this will save us work.
          üëâ **Tip:** The _smaller_ the reproduction, the _faster_ we can debug and resolve your issue

        - Set the `start` script in `package.json` to the command that shows the bug
