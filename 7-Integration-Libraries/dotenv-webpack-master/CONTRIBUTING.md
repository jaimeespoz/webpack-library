Pull requests will be **considered** if they pass the following criteria:

1. Code passes all unit tests.

If all of the above is passed, your request will be considered. Please allow

## Commit Format

Commits should match the suggested workflow and format.

1. Change code.
1. Type `git commit -a -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"`
    1. The [standardjs](http://standardjs.com/) linter will run.
    1. We also use default parameters from [validate-commit-msg](https://github.com/kentcdodds/validate-commit-msg) for validation.
1. Type `git push`
    1. Tests will run before the commit is pushed to validate everything still runs as expected.
