Before submitting an issue, please search the issue tracker first. Your issue may already be solved
or closed for a previous reason.

If you have a general question about webpack or gulp or streams please use their appropriate support
channels or stackoverflow.com. Not this issue tracker please.

When submitting an issue, please provide:

* A detailed description of the issue.
* Steps on how to reproduce.

Keep in mind, this is not a gulp plugin. If your issue relates to gulp you are fully expected to
reduce your issue to how it relates to this library.

Your issue can be closed for any reason. It's nothing personal. Just a consequence of a lot of users
and only 1 active maintainer. Thank you for understanding.
