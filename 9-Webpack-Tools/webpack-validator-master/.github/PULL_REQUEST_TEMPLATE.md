#    This project is unlikely to have any active         #
#    development due to webpack 2.2.0 having built-in    #
#    support for validation. Please upgrade webpack      #
#    and uninstall webpack-validator                     #

If you _must_ file a pull request, just know that we'll
only really consider merging things which are really
critical for fixing for Webpack 1.x. We're not going to merge
anything to fix Webpack 2 related issues. Your PR will be
closed if it's for Webpack 2.
